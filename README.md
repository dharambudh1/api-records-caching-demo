# API Records Caching

## About this app:

So, this application fetches data from the server and stores those data locally on our device. So, you can view the records even when you don't have an active internet connection. It is a kind of API records caching.

Firstly, the app will constantly be looking for internet connection changes.

If the app finds well-established internet, it will request the server for the latest updates. If the server provides positive responses, the app will remove all old stored records and store the latest fetched records.

Else if the app does not have well-established internet, it will show an appropriate message & the app will show the pre-fetched stored records.
